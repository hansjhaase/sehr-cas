    <p style="font-size: 0.8em;">
      This is a <b>SEHR community host</b> - a server for a 
      group of facilities and people sharing and managing patients in health care.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 0.8em; text-align: center; color: #007895; font-weight: bold;">
      Unfortunately the owner of this zone did not create a presentation page.<br/> 
      So the SEHR team will give you some informations.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 0.8em;">
      Basically there is one host that ties some health care facilities (centers) of a region, community 
      or group of participants together. This host serves some or more applications for managing the EHR (electronic health records) 
      of their shared patients. Any (invited) facility may become a so called 'center'.
      A 'center' produces and consumes medical records for documentation and 
      planned procedures to support their patients during a defined (registered) episode of care.

    <p style="font-size: 0.8em;">
      The purpose of this site is to manage and monitor the community (group) of 
      care providers and their applications. This page is not intended to be used by patients. 
      Patients are welcome to use SEHR applications for a self-managed EHR.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 0.8em;">
      To share medical data there are many issues that has to be solved and discussed. 
      <!-- <b>SEHR</b> is only a
      framework to build such services based on norms like EN13606 or the 
      <a href="http://www.openehr.org" target="_blank">openEHR</a> project. -->

      This service is a demonstration and field trial to use the <b>SEHR</b> 
      libraries for managing care for a long period of time. <b>The first data, that have been 
      processed, are from 2005 and are still available to the facilities of one of the first communities (a zone) in Germany.</b>
    </p>
    <h3>The SEHR team is looking forward to implementing your idea</h3>
    <p style="font-size: 0.8em;">
      <b>2013/2014:</b> The Institute IFETH starts a project with the
      Univ. of the Philippines, Manila, in the field of public health. The aim of
      the project is to implement a patient related service based on SEHR to let 
      them request and store their medical records by smartphones. In this project the
      huge infrastructure of smartphones owned by the people will be the 
      carrier for each individual medical record to assist health services.
